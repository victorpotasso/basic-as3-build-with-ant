Just go to the project directory on Terminal and run the command `ant` or `ant -buildfile build.xml`.\r\nThese commands will run a default task on `buid.xml`. Also you can run a specific task e.g `ant preloader`.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n------\r\n\r\n+ [Valck](http://github.com/valck) for support me.\r\n+ [Arthur Debert](https://github.com/arthur-debert) for [BulkLoader](https://github.com/arthur-debert/BulkLoader)\r\n+ [Greensock](http://www.greensock.com/) for [TweenMax](http://www.greensock.com/tweenmax/)\r\n\r\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) Â© [Victor Potasso](http://victorpotasso.com)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
