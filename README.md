# Basic AS3 build with ANT

What is it?
-----------
It's a basic AS3 build with Apache ANT.

Getting Started
-----

**Configuration**

First of all you have to configure some variables on `buid.properties`.


**Build**

It's very simple. Just go to the project directory on Terminal and run the command `ant` or `ant -buildfile build.xml`.
These commands will run a default task on `buid.xml`. Also you can run a specific task e.g `ant preloader`.
